# Github Search App

This is a sample app made possible with public APIs like [Github](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and many
open source technologies like [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava),  [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger), [Retrofit 2](https://github.com/square/retrofit), [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) and more. 

## Architecture

The app is using the MVP pattern so that the presentation layer is testable. It also uses `Dagger 2`  to externalize the creation of dependencies from the classes that use them.
